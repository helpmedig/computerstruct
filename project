    <h1>Logic</h1>

  <br><b>The aim of Logic is to dictate true and false values for a pair of conditions.</b></br>
  <br>These conditions are usually denoted by the symbols p and q.</br>
  Logical operators are then applied to each truth value for p and q.
</p>
<h1>Negation</h1>
<p style="color:green">
  Negation of a condition is represented by "¬"
  <br>Negation flips the truth value of a condition</br>

<h1> The "And" Operator</h1>
<p style="color:red">
The "and" operator is represented by "∧" symbol.
  <br>In order for the and operator to give an output of true, both p and q must be true.</br>
  If even one of the conditions are false, then the output must be false.
  <br></br>

<br></br>
Think back to our unit on the union and intersection
<br>The and operator would be represented by the intersection, in other words, the elements that are in both sets.</br>
<br></br>
</p>
<p>
  In the picture below, the "and" operator covers the "my name" section

</p>
<h1>The "Or" Operator</h1>
<p>
  the "Or" operator is represented by the "V sign".
In order for the "Or" operator to be true,<b> at least</b> one of the conditions p or q must be true.
<br>The "Or" operator only gives a false output when <b>both</b> conditions p and q are false.</br>

  <br>In terms of Venn Diagrams, The "Or" symbol is represented by the Union.</br>

</p>
<h1>The "Xor" Operator</h1>
<p>
The "Xor" Operator plays the role of exclusive or.
<br> This means that in order to have a true output exactly one out of the two conditions must be true</br>
<br>Xor is represented by "⊻" sign.</br>

</p>
<h1>Conditionals</h1>
<p>
  A conditional statement is the traditional "if-then" statement. The only way that this statement is false is if the initial condition is true but the subsequent condition is false.
  <br></br>
  <br>the symbol for a conditional is "→"</br>

</p>
<h1>Bi-Conditionals</h1>
<p>
  A bi-conditional statement will yeild a true output if both conditions have the same input.
  <br>In other words, if both p and q are true or if both p and q are false then the output is true.</br>
  <br> the bi-conditional is marked with the "←→" symbol.</br>
